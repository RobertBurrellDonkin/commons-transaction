Commons Transaction Release 2.0 beta1
-------------------------------------

RELEASE NUMBER: 2.0b1
RELEASE TAG / BRANCH: none yet / TRANSACTION_2

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Commons Transaction 2 aims at providing classes that aid concurrent programming in a transactional style.

This beta is the first 2.0 release that tries to overcome the most
annoying issues with 1.x in a more radical way:
- migration to the java.util.concurrent  package
- full support for Java 5 generics
- support for a component based approach (by factoring out each interesting aspect into an interface plus default implementation)
- usage of commons logging
- full file management features for the transactional file system


There are implementations for:
- locks managers, 
- transactional maps, and
- transactional file access, plus
- some helper classes
