<h1>Locking:</h1>

<p>Central package for locking related stuff. It contains interfaces and implementations to handle your locks in a transactional way. That means you divide your work in blocks and free all locks accumulated in that block at its very end. A common, shared timeout protects all locking requests.

<p>The central interface is the one of the 
<a href="LockManager.html">lock manager</a>. 
It's recommended implementation is the 
<a href="RWLockManager.java">read/write lock manager</a> that 
features read/write locks and efficient deadlock detection.

<p>If you have hierarchical resources to lock you can use the
<a href="HierarchicalLockManager.html">hierarchical lock manager interface </a>
with its <a href="DefaultHierarchicalLockManager.html">default implementation</a>.

<p>If you need a custom implementation of a lock mamanger it is recommended 
to base your work on the <a href="AbstractLockManager.html">on an abstract base</a>.
