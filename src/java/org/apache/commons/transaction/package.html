<h1>Apache Commons Transaction</h1>
<p>Making concurrent programming transactional.
<p>This package contains the most important interfaces of the whole component. 
If you want to add transaction control to your resource managers you will have to implement the 
<a href="TransactionalResourceManager.html">transactional resource manager interface</a>. It is recommended that you start your work by inheriting from
the <a href="AbstractTransactionalResourceManager.html">abstract transactional resource manager</a>.


<p>The user is supposed to control transactionality using the methods of this interface.
<p>In case you want more than one transactional resource manager to take part in a single transaction use the 
<a href="Transaction.html">transaction interface</a> along with its <a href="DefaultTransaction.html">default implementation</a>.
Resource managers that want to participate need to be <a href="ManageableResourceManager.html">manageable resource managers</a>. This interface
is not supposed to be called by the user, but is used by the complex transaction.
