For 2.0:

- Finish tx file resource manager
  - (KISS): Do not use the dirty/shutdown/etc. crap
  - Delegate all calls to the TxContxt
  
- Unify Architecture of MapWrappers and TxFileResourceManager
  - Optimally, only a single Wrapper remains
  - All implementations shall be based on AbstractTxContext

- Maybe get rid of lock policy. Could well be integrated into AbstractTxContext
  - Question: Is there a need for a different kind of locking?

- Merge 
  - org.apache.commons.transaction.TransactionalResource with 
  - org.apache.commons.transaction.xa.TransactionalResource
  - same with the abstract impementations

- We do not need suspend/resume/etc. in AbstractTransactionManager, we can leave this to the xa transaction manager
