For 2.0:

- Finish tx file resource manager
  - (KISS): Do not use the dirty/shutdown/etc. crap
  - Delegate all calls to the TxContxt
  
- Unify Architecture of MapWrappers and TxFileResourceManager
  - Optimally, only a single Wrapper remains
  - All implementations shall be based on AbstractTxContext

- Port JCA implementation for Map from 1.x
